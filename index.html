<h2>About me</h2>
<p>As of Winter 2025, I am a 4th year graduate student at University of California San Diego. I work in algebraic number theory. Currently I have <a href="https://kskedlaya.org">Kiran Kedlaya</a> and <a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~apollack/">Aaron Pollack</a> as advisors. I expect to graduate in 2027. <br> <a href="about/XuChrisResume.pdf">Here</a> is my CV.</p>

<h2>What I'm thinking about</h2>
<h3>Rational points on curves</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Say you have a modular curve. You want to work with the modular curve without ever needing an equation for it. It turns out you can use the moduli interpretation (elliptic curves with some level structure) and things will work out just as well. You also have a good supply of points that are defined over number fields that aren't too complicated: those are the CM points and cusps. They are dense in the modular curve and in particular cover every residue disk. (For Shimura curves things are even easier because you already have a p-adic uniformization with which you can then apply Chabauty to, modular curves only enjoy this near the cusps.)</li>
    <li>Develop an explicit theory for Noam Kantor's thesis (see also a recent paper of Corwin-Zehavi). I like to call this the CKLV method, meaning "Chabauty-Coleman-Kantor-Kim-Lawrence-Venkatesh", where it is understood that the "C" and "K" are each referring to two people. It is basically what you would think of if you tried to combine the methods of Chabauty-Kim and Lawrence-Venkatesh. Hopefully an explicit theory will give stronger dimension bounds than simply motivic (unipotent) Chabauty, so you won't have to go to as high of a depth, and ergo save on computation effort.</li>
    <li>Say you have a modular curve. You want to find all of its rational points. You would like to automate this process. Here is a brief strategy for such an algorithm. Concretely, input a modular curve of arbitrary level H (call this X_H) and a number field K; output X_H(K). Step 1: find a semistable model of X_H (you can hopefully do this using Jared Weinstein's paper and then quotienting out by H). Step 2: perform quadratic or motivic Chabauty on X_H using Jennifer Balakrishnan's papers or David Corwin's papers. (Remark 1: you need a semistable model for both cases; also, the motives associated to X_H are all related to Res_{F_v/Q_p}GL_2, [F := End^0(J_H)], because everything is of GL_2-type, so hopefully things do not get too bad here.) (Remark 2: you might be tempted to look at the line bundle \omega of modular forms and then perform CKLV using the Tannakian category generated by \omega. But this will only work if X_H is representable i.e. there is a universal elliptic curve E -> X_H.) Filling in the blanks of this strategy is one of the ultimate end goals for explicit nonabelian Chabauty.</li>
    <li>You want to prove Serre uniformity in very general settings. (The conjecture gives bounds for how large a prime p you can go before the mod p image of Galois for any elliptic curve has to surject.) One thing you can do is try to apply Runge's method to CM points rather than cusps. This would entail constructing modular functions whose zeroes and poles are supported on a Heegner divisors D i.e. Borcherds products. Note that Runge's method for cusps relies on the fact that rational points on split Cartan modular curves do not intersect the cuspidal divisor, so in our case you need to construct many different modular functions. The hope is that you arrive at a bound that only depends on p (and in particular not on D).</li>
    <li>Michael Stoll has found a genus two curve X over \Q with at least 642 rational points. Its Mordell-Weil rank is at least 22. Can one use motivic Chabauty (involving the representation theory of GSp_4) to prove that #X(\Q) is exactly 642? This would be a good test case for Corwin's work on motivic Chabauty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Automorphic forms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Special cycles on G<sub>2</sub>. You can embed (the split form of) G_2 into O(4,3). From this you can perform a theta lift to the two-fold cover of SL_2. On cohomology classes of G_2, this means that you get half-integral weight modular forms whose coefficients are given by integrals of "special cycles" on G_2. Note that Kudla-Millson have already developed such a theory for orthogonal groups, and that our "special cycle" is just pulled back from the ones that they consider. But the construction that I hope to make will hopefully be simpler than their paper.</li>
    <li>There are three classes of discrete series representations of G<sub>2</sub>. One of them, quarternionic discrete series, has been investigated by Pollack, and there is a nice theory of Fourier coefficients. But there is a more mysterious class that Pollack, in conversations with me, has deemed "middle discrete series". What can we learn about them? For instance, can they be detected by theta lifts from simpler groups?</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I'm learning about</h2>
Some of us number theorists at UCSD have made a Discord server for the purposes of organizing seminars each quarter. In particular to every bullet point below there is a corresponding seminar ongoing right now. Please email <a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~ssahai/" target="_blank">Shubhankar Sahai</a> if you are UCSD affiliated and interested in joining the Discord.
<ul>
    <li>Analytic stacks. Attempting to understand Camargo Rodriguez's paper on the analytic de Rham stack. Also, hopefully the real local Langlands manuscript.</li>
    <li>Modular curves. Katz-Mazur. Trying to learn this thoroughly for obvious purposes (see above).</li>
    <li>Representations of p-adic groups. For the purposes of Arizona Winter School 2025.</li>
</ul>
