<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a 3rd year graduate student at UCSD, working under <a href="https://kskedlaya.org">Kiran Kedlaya</a> and <a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~apollack/">Aaron Pollack</a>. I expect to graduate in 2027. I'm interested in number theory, arithmetic geometry, homotopy theory and everything in between.

<h2>What I'm thinking about</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Almost all current methods for finding rational points on modular curves involve first finding a plane model before implementing quadratic Chabauty. With Kiran Kedlaya, I am currently developing a way to work directly with the moduli space without using any defining equations. Expect a draft to appear "soon".</li>
    <li>With Aaron Pollack, I am investigating relations between cohomology classes of certain special cycles on the symmetric space associated to the split real form of G_2. Investigating these relations involves producing half-integral weight modular forms via theta lifting. Expect a draft to appear "soon".</li>
    <li>To show that BB(5) = 47,176,870, there are only a few holdout 5-state Turing machines to check that do not halt. My paper below tackles arguably the most difficult of them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Seminars</h2>
Thanks to a large arithmetic geometry and homotopy theory group, there are quite a few student-ran seminars each quarter. This quarter I am participating in:
<ul>
    <li>Prismatic F-gauges seminar (ran by Nathan Wenger)</li>
    <li>Lawrence-Venkatesh seminar (ran by Matt Broe)</li>
</ul>
In addition, I plan to restart a seminar on FLT next quarter.
